Simple java-based application that focuses on on controlling presentations and brain storming. The software supports annotating the current screen contents and storing that to an image file.

I tried to create a simple do it yourself method of building your own interactive whiteboard. The software uses the TUIO protocol to get the information on where the light pen is active. The rest just controls the mouse cursor (left clicks only).

I used a Playstation 3 camera (PS 3 eye) that I converted so that it could see infrared. I put a layer of exposed film over it so visible light is reduced as much as possible. As a result, a infrared LED soldered to a battery is all I need to control the mouse cursor. See the youtube video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaIUWksQR2s
